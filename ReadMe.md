# Readme

This repository contains some notes I took from reading different books and from different sources.

The main book used as a source is Software Architect's Handbook by Joseph Ingeno, published by Packt publishing.

I will share my learning on Twitter [in a specific thread](https://twitter.com/BelloneDavide/status/1437517622938148870). Feel free to reach me out there.
